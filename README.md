To view your Jupyter notebook with JavaScript content rendered or to share your notebook files with others you can use nbviewer. https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

If you're having trouble rendering Jupyter Notebook files in static HTML, you can convert the file locally on the command line by using the nbconvert command:

jupyter nbconvert --to html NOTEBOOK-NAME.ipynb
